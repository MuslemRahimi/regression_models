In this repository we will show how to build regression models to predict the close price of your favorite stocks for the next 30 days. 


We experimented with linear regression, support vector regressor and random forest regressor but the code can be easily extended to include other regression models too. 

The result of the linear regression model can be seen here:

Furthermore we compared the three different regression models based on the variance score and r2 score on their training and test dataset.
